# Uncommon HTML DOM Manipulation Bug
This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to DOM manipulation in HTML.  The bug arises when attempting to access properties of a DOM element that has already been removed from the DOM. This often happens in scenarios involving dynamic content updates, where elements are removed before the code referencing them finishes execution. 

## Bug Description
The code attempts to access the `textContent` property of a div element *after* that element has been removed from the DOM using `removeChild`. This results in an error because the element no longer exists in the document.

## How to Reproduce
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Open your browser's developer console (usually by pressing F12).
3. Observe the error message indicating that the element is no longer part of the DOM.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that references to DOM elements are checked for validity before accessing their properties.  Always verify that the element still exists within the DOM before attempting to manipulate it.
